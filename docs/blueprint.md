- Primary color: Texas A&M Maroon (#500000) for a strong and recognizable identity.
- Secondary color: Texas A&M White (#FFFFFF) for contrast and readability.
- Accent color: A gradient from Maroon to White, used sparingly to highlight important dates and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Roboto', a modern sans-serif, provides clear readability and a professional feel.
- Use minimalist icons with a Texas A&M theme (e.g., an outline of the state or a subtle '12th Man' reference) to represent assignment types and calendar events.
- A clean, linear layout will allow students to efficiently navigate uploaded syllabi and displayed calendar events.
- Use subtle animations to provide a pleasant user experience and keep students more attentive, such as when uploading and previewing the extracted calendar information. Animations should incorporate the Maroon and White colors.
